This is just an outline of what I need to write for Program 9.

End Goals:
    Total rainfall for the year
    Average Monthly rainfall
    Highest rainfall month
    Lowest rainfall month

Stipulations:
    No global variables
    At least 4 functions
    Main() should drive the functions, no calculations within main()

Rough Draft / Outline of the program:

def main():

    userInput()
    rainfall_List_Accumulator, avg_Monthly = data_Input()
    highest_Rainfall, lowest_Rainfall, = rainfall_Calculations()


data_Input():

    data = open('Program9.txt', 'r')
    line_Read = data.readline()
    while line_Read != '':
        words = line_Read.split()
        rainfall_List_Accumulator += words
        
        # Create a list of months and compare the indices to the text files monthly listings.
        # Then return those values to main(), where it will then be forwarded to the
        # rainfall_Calculations function.
        print("Debugging:", words
        line_Read = data.deadline()
        
    return(rainfall_List_Accumulator)
 
rainfall_Calculations():
    avg_Monthly = rainfall_List_Accumulator / 12
    highest_Rainfall = index(max(rainfall_List))
    lowest_Rainfall = index(min(rainfall_List))
        

data_Output():1
    print("Blah blah:", rainfall_List_Accumulator)
    print("Blah Blah:", avg_Monthly)
    print("Blah:", highest_Rainfall)
    print("Blah:", lowest_Rainfall)

main()
