//	DUE:		

	//	Write a program that can determine the number of days in a month for a specified month and year.
	//	The program should allow a user to enter two integers representing a month and a year, and it should determine how many days are in the specified month.
	//	The integers 1 through 12 will be used to identify the months of January through Decemeber.
	//	The user indicates the end of input by entering 0 for the month and year.
	//	
	//	At that point, the program prints the number of days in the current month and terminates.
	//	
	//	Use the following creiteria to identify Leap Years:
	//	1.	'Y' is divisible by 100.
	//		'Y' is also divisible by 400.
	//			For example: 2000 = Leap Year, but 2100 isn't.
	//	
	//	2.	'Y' is not divisible by 100.
	//		'Y' is divisible by 4.
	//			For example: 2008 = Leap Year, but 2009 isn't.
	//	
	//	Example Output:
	//		Enter month and year: 2 2008[ENTER]
	//			29 days
	//		Enter month and year: 0 0[ENTER]
	//			The current month, September 2009, has 30 days.
